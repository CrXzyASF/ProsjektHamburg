    <ul><h2 class="h22">Introduction to Group Training</h2></ul>
    <ul><p>Join our energetic and motivating group training sessions at MyFitnessGeek! 
        Group training offers a dynamic and supportive environment where you can work out alongside 
        like-minded individuals, push your limits, and achieve remarkable results together. Led by our 
        experienced instructors, our group classes are designed to challenge you, keep you accountable, 
        and make fitness fun.</p></ul><br>
        <h2 class="h22">Why Choose Group Training?</h2>
        <p><strong>Motivation through Community:</strong> Sweat it out with a group of individuals who 
            share your commitment to health and fitness. Our group classes foster camaraderie and 
            encouragement, motivating you to give your best effort in every session.</p>
        <p><strong>Expert Guidance:</strong> Our certified instructors will lead you through each 
            workout, providing guidance on proper form, technique, and modifications as needed. 
            They’ll ensure that you get the most out of every exercise while minimizing the risk of 
            injury.</p>
        <p><strong>Variety of Workouts:</strong> From high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and 
            circuit training to yoga and Pilates, we offer a diverse range of group classes to suit 
            every fitness level and preference.</p>
        <p><strong>Affordability:</strong> Group training is a cost-effective option compared to one-on-one 
            personal training. You get the benefits of professional instruction and peer support at 
            a fraction of the cost.</p>
        <p><strong>Accountability:</strong> Consistency is key to achieving your fitness goals. 
            With scheduled group classes, you’re more likely to stick to your workout routine and 
            stay on track towards your objectives.</p>

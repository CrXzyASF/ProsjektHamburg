# Hamburg (Germany) Project

In this project we created the graphic user interface (website) for our group. 
We added simple pages like index which is the home page and other pages for information about the services that we are supposed to provide.
We also added a payment page for the monthly plans we created. (No scams included)

The theme of this website is fitness so we had to make it somewhat a fitness website using a icon provided by the task.
